# 2025.11.30 - John 6

[[John-06]]:24-69
"Good is the enemy of the great" - Jim Collins
Jesus was talking to the crowd using words they understood
What are the people's motivation?
The crowd is only interested in bread
back then people were poor, so if they meet a man who can multiply bread, it would solve a lot of their problems
Jesus did have the power to solve their bread problem, but that's not what Jesus came to do
a lot of problems in our world today
we should work hard to alleviate suffering, but even if we were successful and created a world where people are comfortably away from God, it still wouldn't be good.
Bible says we'll all be in heaven or hell
Jesus' miracles are signs
signs for Disneyland is meant to point you to where to go, not for you to stop and take pictures
eternal life is not just a quantity of life but a quality of life
bios vs zoe - not just prolonged existence
Grover - "they lose their will to stay immortal"
a picture of hell - living a long time but not experiencing the way God meant for us to live
quality of life that will never end
[[John-06]]:35
we don't need Jesus to give us more snacks, but we need the main course
Pascal - God-shaped vacuum
our friends are just trying to subsist on snacks rather than real food.
# how do we get this life?
eat him
you are what you eat
spiritually, he has to come in and become a part of us
for Christian, Christ will be in us
not just adding Jesus to our life
[[Gal-02]]:20
unless we allow Jesus to become part of our lives, we will die like the Israelites 
the only thing that matters is where we go after we die
[[Matt-26]]:26-28
maybe at that moment they understood
Jesus didn't come to solve our earthly problems but our deeper spiritual problems
what am I chasing?
popularity, comfort, friends - we'll never be satisfied
these snacks will never fully satisfied
we're looking to satisfy a spiritual need with physical things
is it a hard saying because we have so much on our agenda?
